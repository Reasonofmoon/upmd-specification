## 1. Introduction

Unified Prompt Markdown (UPMD) is a next-generation prompt language designed to bridge the gap between traditional programming languages and natural language prompting. It integrates quantum computing principles and context-aware technologies to provide a more intuitive and powerful AI control mechanism.

## 2. Design Goals

The primary design goals of UPMD are:

- Simplicity: Easy to learn and use for both programmers and non-programmers
- Expressiveness: Ability to express complex AI interactions and workflows
- Extensibility: Easily extendable to accommodate new AI capabilities
- Interoperability: Seamless integration with existing systems and data formats
- Context Awareness: Ability to adapt based on conversational context
- Quantum Inspiration: Utilization of quantum concepts for enhanced expressiveness

## 3. Core Concepts

### 3.1 Quantum State Variables

UPMD introduces quantum state variables that can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed.

Syntax:
```upmd
|quantum_variable: name| = {state1: probability1, state2: probability2, ...}
```

Example:
```upmd
|quantum_variable: mood| = {happy: 0.6, sad: 0.3, angry: 0.1}
```

### 3.2 Context-Aware Dynamic Grammar

UPMD adjusts its grammar based on conversational context, enabling more natural interactions.

Syntax:
```upmd
|context: parameter| = {level1: probability1, level2: probability2, ...}

|dynamic_grammar|
  [level1] Grammar rules for level1
  [level2] Grammar rules for level2
  ...
|/dynamic_grammar|
```

Example:
```upmd
|context: expertise| = {beginner: 0.2, intermediate: 0.5, expert: 0.3}

|dynamic_grammar|
  [beginner] Use simple terms and detailed explanations
  [intermediate] Use domain-specific terms with moderate explanations
  [expert] Use advanced terms with concise explanations
|/dynamic_grammar|
```

### 3.3 Multi-Modal I/O Orchestration

UPMD provides a unified approach to handling various input and output modalities.

Syntax:
```upmd
|multimodal_input|
  [modality1] input_data1
  [modality2] input_data2
  ...
|/multimodal_input|

|multimodal_output|
  [modality1] output_function1(parameters)
  [modality2] output_function2(parameters)
  ...
|/multimodal_output|
```

Example:
```upmd
|multimodal_input|
  [voice] user_voice_input
  [gesture] user_gesture_data
  [text] user_text_input
|/multimodal_input|

|multimodal_output|
  [voice] text_to_speech("Hello, how can I assist you?")
  [image] display(welcome_image.jpg)
  [text] "Please select a service:"
|/multimodal_output|
```

### 3.4 Quantum Entanglement-Based Context Management

UPMD uses the concept of quantum entanglement to manage complex contextual relationships.

Syntax:
```upmd
|quantum_entanglement: variable1, variable2, ...|
  [state1, state2, ...] = probability
  ...
|/quantum_entanglement|
```

Example:
```upmd
|quantum_entanglement: weather, mood|
  [sunny, happy] = 0.4
  [rainy, sad] = 0.3
  [cloudy, neutral] = 0.2
  [snowy, excited] = 0.1
|/quantum_entanglement|
```

### 3.5 Self-Optimizing Prompts

UPMD includes mechanisms for self-evaluation and optimization of prompts.

Syntax:
```upmd
|self_optimize|
  goal: optimization_goal
  criteria:
    - criterion1
    - criterion2
    ...
  interval: optimization_interval
|/self_optimize|

|feedback_loop|
  [positive] reinforce_current_settings()
  [negative] adjust_settings({
    parameter1: new_value1,
    parameter2: new_value2,
    ...
  })
|/feedback_loop|
```

Example:
```upmd
|self_optimize|
  goal: maximize_user_satisfaction
  criteria:
    - response_accuracy
    - conversation_naturalness
    - task_completion_speed
  interval: every_10_interactions
|/self_optimize|

|feedback_loop|
  [positive] reinforce_current_settings()
  [negative] adjust_settings({
    verbosity: decrease,
    examples: increase,
    technical_level: decrease
  })
|/feedback_loop|
```

## 4. Syntax and Structure

### 4.1 Basic Structure

UPMD documents consist of a series of blocks, each enclosed in pipe characters |. Blocks can be nested to express hierarchical structures.

### 4.2 Comments

Comments in UPMD are enclosed in double parentheses.

Example:
```upmd
(( This is a comment ))
```

### 4.3 Variables and Data Types

UPMD supports various data types including strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and dictionaries. Variables are declared using the @ symbol.

Example:
```upmd
@user_name = "John Doe"
@age = 30
@is_student = true
@hobbies = ["reading", "painting", "coding"]
@profile = {
  "name": @user_name,
  "age": @age,
  "occupation": "engineer"
}
```

### 4.4 Control Structures

UPMD provides control structures similar to traditional programming languages but with more natural language-like syntax.

Example:
```upmd
|if: @age >= 18|
  You are eligible to vote.
|else|
  You are not yet eligible to vote.
|/if|

|for_each: @hobby in @hobbies|
  You enjoy @hobby.
|/for_each|
```

### 4.5 Functions

Functions in UPMD are defined using the |function: syntax.

Example:
```upmd
|function: greet(@name)|
  Hello, @name! Welcome to UPMD.
|/function|

|call: greet("John Doe")|
```

## 5. AI Model Integration

UPMD is designed to work seamlessly with various AI models and APIs. It provides built-in functions for common AI tasks.

Example:
```upmd
|ai_task: sentiment_analysis|
  input: "I really love using UPMD for AI interactions!"
  model: "sentiment_analyzer_v1"
  output: @sentiment
|/ai_task|

The sentiment of the input is: @sentiment
```

## 6. Extensibility

UPMD allows for the definition of custom blocks and functions, making it easily extendable for specific use cases.

Example:
```upmd
|define_block: custom_analysis|
  |parameter: text|
  |parameter: analysis_type|
  
  (( Custom analysis logic ))
  
  |return: result|
|/define_block|

|custom_analysis|
  text: "Sample text for analysis"
  analysis_type: "semantic"
|/custom_analysis|
```

## 7. Security and Privacy

UPMD includes built-in features for handling sensitive information and ensuring data privacy.

Example:
```upmd
|sensitive_data: user_password|
  (( Encrypted storage and processing ))
|/sensitive_data|

|privacy_policy|
  data_retention: 30_days
  data_usage: ["personalization", "aggregate_analytics"]
  user_consent_required: true
|/privacy_policy|
```

## 8. Interoperability

UPMD provides mechanisms for importing and exporting data in various formats, such as JSON, XML, and CSV.

Example:
```upmd
|import: user_data.json|
  @user_profile = JSON_parse(file_contents)
|/import|

|export: analysis_results.csv|
  format: CSV
  data: @analysis_results
|/export|
```

## 9. Version Control and Collaboration

UPMD supports version control and collaborative editing through special syntax blocks.

Example:
```upmd
|version: 1.2.3|
|author: John Doe|
|last_modified: 2024-03-15T14:30:00Z|

|changelog|
  - Added new sentiment analysis feature
  - Improved context handling
  - Fixed bug in multimodal output
|/changelog|
```
